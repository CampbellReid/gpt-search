"GPT Search" does not collect any personal information, including chat data. This document may later change.

### Data safety

Chats are cached locally to allow for fast searches. If another person has access to your computer, they might be able to look at your cached chats even if you're not signed in to ChatGPT. 

To remove cached chats, uninstall the extension or "Reset cache" in the options page. If you're using a shared computer, it's recommended to enable 'Session-only caching' in the options page.
